## How does this carousel works?

Carousel maps each child it receives on its own slide. For example, the code bellow will result in three slides with each element. 
```javascript

<Carousel slidesDisplay={1}>
  <img src={"dog.jpeg"} className={"slideItem"} alt={"Dog"}/>
  <img src={"cat.png"} className={"slideItem"} alt={"Cat"}/>
  <img src={"bird.png"} className={"slideItem"} alt={"Bird"}/>
</Carousel>

```

However, in this case image of dog and cat will be rendered on the same slide and image of bird will have its own.
```javascript

<Carousel slidesDisplay={1}>
  <div className={"slideItem"}>
    <img src={"dog.jpeg"} alt={"Dog"}/>
    <img src={"cat.png"}  alt={"Cat"}/>
  <div>
  <img src={"bird.png"} className={"slideItem"} alt={"Bird"}/>
</Carousel>

```

## How to use the Carousel?

It's easy to use. Just use it. Each child that has to be rendered on a slide should have slideItem class. To show multiple elements on the same slide, they have to be encapsulated in divs. 

The props of slidesDisplay dictates how many slides are shown at the same time. By default it is set to 1.

```javascript
const App = () => {
    return(
           <Carousel>
                <img src={"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*mk1-6aYaf_Bes1E3Imhc0A.jpeg"} className={"slideItem"} alt={"Baby yoda"}/>
               <img src={"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Image_created_with_a_mobile_phone.png/1200px-Image_created_with_a_mobile_phone.png"} className={"slideItem"} alt={"phone"}/>
           </Carousel>
    )

}
```
